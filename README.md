# COMPSCI-2-Final
Final Project for COMPSCI-2
Game is pretty straight forward. When it starts click on enemies to add points to your score and make them disapear so more enmies can spaw
Do not let enemies hit bottom of screen or they will reduce one healthpoint from your health
You will get higher point amounts for the smaller enemies which is why they are harder to hit
Once game ends a leaderboard will display, have yet to add the function to allow user to enter name
To close window simply hit the x on the top left of the screen, game will not close on its own
Do not forget to also close the console window that pops up, otherwise txt file will not update in further trials
If program does not work it is most likely due to the SFML files not being uploaded propperly. Try only downloading the game files without SFML and then manually adding SFML into the project directories
